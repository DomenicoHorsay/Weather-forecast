<h1>Climate-App Project<h1>

<p>This is the Clima-App project, a weather status page developed using the OpenWeatherMap API. In this project, I created a simple, responsive page that allows users to search for a city's weather forecast and displays information such as temperature, wind speed, and sky conditions.<p>
